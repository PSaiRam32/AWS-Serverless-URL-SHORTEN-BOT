# Serverless-URL-SHORTEN-BOT

OBJECTIVE: A Telegram Bot to convert long URLs to Short URLs Using AWS Serverless Services.

What is Serverless?

Serverless is a cloud-native development model that refers to serverless applications. Serverless applications are ones that donâ€™t need any server provision and do not require managing servers.

Services Used for Fabricating:

I have used 3 different Services to develop the Bot:

1)AWS Lambda

2)AWS API Gateway

3)AWS Cloud Watch

4)Clean Uri Api
